This is a Basic E commerce Application. It uses Node, Express , MongoDB and a bunch of third party packages. On loading all the products will be shown on the screen and details of a particular product can be seen via a link. A User can sign-up and then login to the app to create a new product. A signed in user can edit or delete the product created by himself. A User can reset his password if s/he forgets the password via a link sent through email. A User can add items to the cart and then with a dummy stripe setup can also place and order and generate the PDF of the invoice of that order.
